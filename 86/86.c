/* Trivia

 * A function is a self-contained unit of program code designed to accomplish a
   particular task. In general, a function can both produce actions and provide
   values.
 * Functions should be used because they help avoid repetitious programming.
   Also, they make a program more modular, hence easier to read and easier to
   change or fix.
 * If functions are made general enough, they can be reused in other programs.
 * Thinking about what a function should do and how it relates to the program
   as a whole should be done before worrying about writing the code for it.

 * The process of a function calling itself is known as recursion. Recursion is
   a sometimes tricky, sometimes convenient tool.
 * Recursion often can be used where loops can be used. Sometimes the loop
   solution is more obvious; sometimes the recursive solution is more obvious.
   Recursive solutions tend to be more elegant, but less efficient than loop
   solutions.
