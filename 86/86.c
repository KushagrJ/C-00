/* Trivia

 * A function is a self-contained unit of program code designed to accomplish a
   particular task. In general, a function can both produce actions and provide
   values.
 * Functions should be used because they help avoid repetitious programming.
   Also, they make a program more modular, hence easier to read and easier to
   change or fix.
 * If functions are made general enough, they can be reused in other programs.
 * Thinking about what a function should do and how it relates to the program
   as a whole should be done before worrying about writing the code for it.
